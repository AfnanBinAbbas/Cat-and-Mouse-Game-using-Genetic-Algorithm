# Cat and Mouse Split-Screen Game ðŸŽ®

A split-screen **Cat and Mouse game** built using Python's Pygame library. The game allows players to place mousetraps strategically to eliminate enemies (mice) while competing against an AI using a **genetic algorithm** for mousetrap placement.

## Features

-  **Split-Screen Gameplay**: Compete against the AI in a split-screen environment.
-  **Genetic Algorithm**: The AI uses a genetic algorithm to decide optimal mousetrap placement.
-  **Mousetrap Defense Mechanics**: Place mousetraps manually to attack and defeat incoming enemies (mice).
-  **Sound Effects and Music**: Background music and effects enhance gameplay.
-  **Dynamic Win Conditions**: Compete to eliminate a set number of enemies (mice) before the AI does.

1. **Start the Game**:
   - Run the Python script.
   - Press `ENTER` at the main menu to begin.

2. **Placing Mousetraps**:
   - Use the **mouse** to click on the left side of the screen (Player's side) to place mousetraps.
   - Mousetraps will automatically attack nearby enemies (mice).

3. **Objective**:
   - Eliminate **5 enemies (mice)** before the AI to win the game.

4. **AI Side**:
   - The AI will automatically place mousetraps and eliminate enemies (mice) using its pre-calculated strategy.

## Game Overview

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73097560/115834477-dbab4500-a447-11eb-908a-139a6edaec5c.gif">

### Grid Layout:
- The screen is divided into **two halves**:
   - Left Half: Player's area for mousetrap placement.
   - Right Half: AI's area for automated mousetrap placement.

### mousetraps:
- **Player**: Manually places mousetraps using mouse clicks.
- **AI**: Automatically places mousetraps using Genetic algorithm.

### enemies (mouse):
- Move randomly but stay within grid boundaries.
- Have health bars that decrease when hit by mousetraps.

---

## Notes

- Ensure all **music and sound effect files** are located in the specified `tracks` folder.
- Modify the `n` variable in the code to adjust the number of targets(mouse) required to win.

---

## Future Improvements (To-Do)

- Add more **enemy types** with different behaviors.
- Implement **upgradable mousetraps**.
- Introduce more **levels** and increasing difficulty.
- Improve AI mousetrap placement strategies for better competition.
